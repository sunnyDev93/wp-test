# Getting Ready to Leave the House

(The "Trip Planner" app)

Sometimes, getting ready to leave the house is difficult.  Families with youngish kids might need to make sure everyone has their shoes and coats.  Even adult humans can sometimes struggle to remember everything they need to do.

The Trip Planner Block combines a To-Do list (checklist of items that need to be done) with a timer.

## Example

Let's say you need to leave the house at 9AM.  You're meeting a friend for a hike, with lunch to follow.

You have a bunch of things you need to remember:

- Bring your wallet
- Put on hiking shoes
- Get your hiking poles out of the closet and bring them
- Fill up your water bottle
- Find bug spray
- Apply sunscreen
- Grab a change of clothes in case you fall in the river again
- Text your friend to confirm the meeting place

If you're like me, you'll never remember all of this!

So in your WordPress site that has this plugin installed you'll create a page and add the block that this plugin defines.You'll put in your departure time (9:00 AM), put your destination in the text box ("Hiking with my bestest friend in the whole world!  Then going to lunch!") and save the page. 

On the next screen, you'll see time starting to tick down to your departure time.  If it's 7:30AM, it'll tell you that you have 1 hour and 30 minutes left.

To remember your tasks, type them into the text box, one by one.  Hit the "+" button or hit Enter, and they'll get added to the list.

As you complete items ("I have successfully applied sunscreen! ðŸŽ‰"), check them off.  Take a moment to bask in your accomplishment.

As time ticks closer and closer to your departure time, the green boxes on the screen might turn yellow.  If you're late, they might even turn red.  This will help you remember:  don't be late!

Good luck on the hike.  Watch out for bears!
